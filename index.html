		<p>
		My first experience with technology was in an elementary computer class where I explored the applications and played typing games on the iMac G3. Using the computer came easy to me, but my peers often had complications. I discovered I had a skill for troubleshooting after resolving their issues and I soon became the go-to person whenever my classmates, friends, family needed help. I enjoyed helping others, so I decided to participate in community efforts such as teaching kids to read, volunteering to raise funds for cancer research, cleaning and clearing up my high school campus. 	
		</p>

		<p>
		Seeing the results after these acts gave me a feeling of accomplishment, and it still serves as my primary motivation today. Creating a safe and comfortable environment is important to me as well, therefore when I am in a team I try to build relationships with them to empathize with their perspectives and understand their circumstances. I believe having this mindset leads to more growth which is my main goal in life.
